This is a MOD for 7 Days To Die Alpha 18.

This adds another recipe to the Cement Mixer so you can make Concrete with Cobblestone and Cement.

I made this because at higher levels Cobblestone is pretty much useless. 
I don't like things wasting space and at the end of the day you would use whatever you have laying around in the apocalypse.

<HOW TO>
Simply place the unzipped file into your 7 Days To Die\Mods Folder.
EG, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods"

You are free to use this MOD any way you like,
however i would like credit if it's used in a MOD Pack and such as it took me quite a long time to make.

Hope you enjoy
